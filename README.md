Dude, Where Is My Bike?
==============

A Citibike data visualization site built with D3 in Angular. Database is handled by Firebase. 

The idea is to draw a bubble map with the bubble size representing the available bike number at each station. Red and green colors were added to visually convey the rate with which the numbers are changing - the redder, the more rapidly it's decreasing, and vice versa. Timestamp and weather icons provide a sense of how many bikers may or may not turn out on that date. The data displayed were from July 29 to August 8, 2014. More data were collected but weren't displayed for perfomance reasons.

A message board feature that's free for all to edit and remove. 

This site is built with D3 on AngularJS. The data were collected from Citibike via a Ruby script on AWS, injected to Firebase by a Node script.
